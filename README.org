* devops
  Since termina/penguin container (default for Crostini) comes with Python3, why not use it instead of bash for getting all the development utilities and repos I will need?

** usage

   #+begin_src shell
$ python3 bootstrap.py <options> [--dry-run]
   #+end_src

   - =options= are any of the recipes in the =TARGETS= dictionary.
   - use =--dry-run= to see what would happen without changing anything.
